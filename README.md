# MMD5 Docset #

![](mmd-dash.png)

This aims to be a User Contributed [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) Docset of the user guide for [MultiMarkdown5](https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-5/).

MultiMarkdown is a derivative of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) that adds new syntax features such as footnotes, tables, metadata, and [LaTeX math formulae](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics). Additionally, it offers mechanisms to convert plain text into LaTeX or HTML.


## Credits ##

* The SQLite Index Population Script is based on @drbraden's [pgdash](https://github.com/drbraden/pgdash).
